# Palace of skills for a better world

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Palace of memories is a technique that allow you to store everything you need to remember in future in an easy way. Just imagine a palace into your mind and put it in some place, in a specific room full of design forniture, into that specific persian mother pearl box on the table in front at the big windows wit a dark blu curtain.  You don't have to remember everything it's enough to remember something connected to the beautiful box. 
 What about if you would be able to  remember the content of that box and could have the possibility to improve it or learn something more. Whether the mistery object were a newspaper article concerning AI what would you say if, at the same time, you were informed about the existence of an on line course call Elements of AI? What would you say  if you were informed also about the University of Helsinki or possibility to improve your english ? 
 In this case your palace full of memories could become the palace of skills allowing you to catch the opportunity to improve your skills, capacities, knowledge, self confidence, chances for your future. 
 The Palace of skills  could be a system that, relying on AI techniques, could be able to develop training models based on the elements present in our choices to remember or store information related to emotions or vice versa not present and therefore representing gaps in our training. Obviously, this is not intended to make us buy something, but to put us in a position to discover free resources, perhaps online, that would allow us to empower ourselves, improve our lives and let us to design the path of our future within the society that has formed us.

## Background

The Palace of memories is a technique that allow you to store everything you need to remember in future in an easy way. Just imagine a palace into your mind and put it in some place, in a specific room full of design forniture, into that specific persian mother pearl box on the table in front at the big windows wit a dark blu curtain.  You don't have to remember everything it's enough to remember something connected to the beautiful box. 
What about if you would be able to  remember the content of that box and could have the possibility to improve it or learn something more. Whether the mistery object were a newspaper article concerning AI what would you say if, at the same time, you were informed about the existence of an on line course call Elements of AI? What would you say  if you were informed also about the University of Helsinki or possibility to improve your english? In this case your palace full of memories could become the palace of skills allowing you to catch the opportunity to improve your skills, capacities, knowledge, self confidence, chances for your future.

This is not intended to make us buy something, but to put us in a position to discover free resources, perhaps online, that would allow us to empower ourselves, improve our lives and let us to design the path of our future within the society that has formed us.

Imagine to be a young adolescent. You are growing up fast to your maturity. You are learning a lot of subjects at school. Your family and friends and society are teaching you a lot of things. Mass media and internet are bombing you with a lot of inputs. You're able to think quite well and you are starting to plan what to do in future. What will you be ? Que serà, serà! 

Obviously  you have dreams you'd like them to come true. You are young with a long path just in front of you but... Outside the world is not so beautiful like we'd like it to be. Climate changes, crisis, unemployment, pollution will affect you future choices. At the same time industry will use your datas and preferences to create new expensive products or trying to influence your choices. Nothing so bad but why don't use this to improve ourselves?

We know that social media, web sites, on line store and others have great collections of data at their disposal to trace our likes.
What we'd need is something like a wiki of ourselves where we could collect our data, information and fact.

Our data represent our history, our tastes related to emotions, actions and relationships. We could learn a lot if we could be helped in analysing the connections between data and our lacks. Imagine what it could represent for people in poorest places in the world. 
There could be adolescents with a background of nothing that could be helped to learn something important for that specific place or for that historical moment and then for a possible future there or elsewhere.   

The leitmotive of the project find his pillars into the concept of a Human-centered AI oriented to 
1) satisfy the needs of less advantaged people; 
2) allow them to use free and really usefull resource;
3) create a value for society; 
4) contribute to a better world.

This must be seen in the context of a background scenario of ethical AI based on the principles of fairness (no discrimination), accountability (everyone have to follow clear rules and have rights and responsibilities), and transparency (people must understand the meaning, the aims and how it works). 

My personal motivation in proposing this is that I believe it is essential to leave a mark even if not tangible and represented only by an idea of what could be developed starting from new skills and knowledge. 
 

## How is it used?

Such a project is primarily aimed at teenagers, but anyone can be a user if they are motivated to improve themselves. 

The project aims to create a tool that gives the possibility to collect data in social media (input) according to a logic of reverse tracking to have them available within a wiki that is enriched by their personal contributions (input) as if it were a real memory palace. On these bases using machine learning and neural networks we might be able to obtain freeand usefull outputs concerned the project aim. 


## Data sources and AI methods

DATA SOURCES  
1) social networks
2) web sites' data
3) search engines' data
4) wikipedia contributions 
5) palace of memories aka own personal wiki 
6) government data 
7) free resources for tuition
8) ong resources for less advantage people 
9) universities and schools' data 
10) other tbd

AI 
1) Machine learning 
2) Neural networks
3) AI-Driven Applications
4) something new tbd

## Challenges

There may be resistance from business operators to making free resources available to a large number of users. At the same time, there may be a lack of confidence in the quality of the resources made available, but this would increase with time and use. 

## What next?

It could be interesting to make of this project an example for a demo to be structured in a university environment with the appropriate AI skills.
