# Palace of skills for a better world
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Palace of memories is a technique that allow you to store everything you need to remember in future in an easy way. Just imagine a palace into your mind and put it in some place, in a specific room full of design forniture, into that specific persian mother pearl box on the table in front at the big windows wit a dark blu curtain.  You don't have to remember everything it's enough to remember something connected to the beautiful box. 
What about if you would be able to  remember the content of that box and could have the possibility to improve it or learn something more. Whether the mistery object were a newspaper article concerning AI what would you say if, at the same time, you were informed about the existence of an on line course call Elements of AI? What would you say  if you were informed also about the University of Helsinki or possibility to improve your english ? 
In this case your palace full of memories could become the palace of skills allowing you to catch the opportunity to improve your skills, capacities, knowledge, self confidence, chances for your future. 
The Palace of skills  could be a system that, relying on AI techniques, could be able to develop training models based on the elements present in our choices to remember or store information related to emotions or vice versa not present and therefore representing gaps in our training. Obviously, this is not intended to make us buy something, but to put us in a position to discover free resources, perhaps online, that would allow us to empower ourselves, improve our lives and let us to design the path of our future within the society that has formed us.  

## Background

Imagine to be a young adolescent. You are growing up fast to your maturity. You are learning a lot of subjects at school. Your family and friends and society are teaching you a lot of things. Mass media and internet are bombing you with a lot of inputs. You're able to think quite well and you are starting to plan what to do in future. What will you be ? Que serà, serà! 

Obviously  you have dreams you'd like them to come true. You are young with a long path just in front of you but... Outside the world is not so beautiful like we'd like it to be. Climate changes, crisis, unemployment, pollution will affect you future choices. At the same time industry will use your datas and preferences to create new expensive products or trying to influence your choices. Nothing so bad but why don't use this to improve ourselves? 

Our data represent our history, our tastes related to emotions, actions and relationships. We could learn a lot if we could be helped in analysing the connections between data and our lacks. Imagine what it could represent for people in poorest places in the world. 
There could be adolescents with a background of nothing that could be helped to learn something important for that specific place or for that historical moment and then for a possible future there or elsewhere.   

The leitmotive of the project find his pillars into the ethical AI based on the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency: 

Fairness: the AI product does not actively or passively discriminate against groups of people in a harmful way.
Accountability: everyone involved in the development and use of the AI product understands, accepts and is able to exercise their rights and responsibilities.
Transparency: the intended users of an AI product can meaningfully understand the purpose of the product, how it works, and (where applicable) how specific decisions were made.



Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.
## How is it used?
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)
If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">
This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]
   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)
   # write your solution here
   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%
main()
```
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
